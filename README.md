Welcome to my MS Word project repository! This project demonstrates my proficiency in using Microsoft Word to create a comprehensive document detailing the functions, roles, and critiques of the Bretton Woods Institutions (BWIs), specifically the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group (WBG).

Project Overview
This document covers several key areas related to the Bretton Woods Institutions:

Introduction: Overview of the Bretton Woods system and its foundational institutions.
Functions of the IMF and WBG: Detailed explanation of their roles in global economic governance.
Surveillance: Bilateral consultations and the Article IV report.
Global Oversight: Periodic IMF reports on regional and global economic trends.
Technical Assistance and Training Programs: Practical support for low- and middle-income countries.
Partnerships with Donors: Leveraging donor financing through multi-donor trust funds.
Criticisms: Key criticisms of BWIs, including under-representation of the Global South, austerity measures, and undermining sovereignty.
Conclusion: Summary of reforms needed to enhance the legitimacy and effectiveness of BWIs.
Document Contents
The document provides an in-depth analysis of each topic, supported by data and figures sourced from reputable websites such as the IMF and World Bank. The figures and charts were independently generated and analyzed to ensure accuracy and relevance, offering a practical demonstration of report creation and data presentation techniques.

Skills Demonstrated
Document Structuring: Organizing content into coherent sections and subsections.
Data Analysis and Presentation: Integrating data and charts to support textual content.
Formatting and Styling: Using MS Word features to enhance readability and visual appeal.
